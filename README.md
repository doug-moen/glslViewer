Live-coding console tool that renders GLSL Shaders. Every file you use (frag/vert shader, images and geometries) are watched for modification, so they can be updated on the fly.

## Install

### Installing in Ubuntu

Install the GLFW 3 library and other dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev git-core
```

Download the glslViewer code, compile and install:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/doug-moen/glslViewer.git
cd glslViewer
make
sudo make install
```

This was tested with Ubuntu 16.04.

These instructions may not work for all users.
For example, it seems that libglfw3-dev conflicts with the older libglfw-dev.
The previous Ubuntu install instructions direct you to
[download and compile glfw3 manually](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html#compile_deps_x11):
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install git-core cmake xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev
cd ~ 
git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
cd glfw
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```

### Installing in RaspberryPi

Do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install glslviewer
```

Or if you want to compile the code your self:

```bash
cd ~ 
git clone http://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer
cd glslViewer
make
sudo make install
```

### Installing in Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S glu glfw-x11
git clone http://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer
cd glslViewer
make
sudo make install
```

### Installing in Mac OSX

You need to [install GLFW](http://www.glfw.org), ```pkg-config``` first and then download the code, compile and install.

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade
brew tap homebrew/versions
brew install glfw3 pkg-config
cd ~ 
git clone http://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer
cd glslViewer
make
make install
```

If glfw3 was installed before, after running the code above, remove glfw3 and try:

```bash
brew install glfw3 pkg-config
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
make
make install
```

## Use

In the most simple scenario you just want to load a fragment shader. For that you need to:

* Run the app passing the shader as an argument

```bash
cd examples
glslViewer test.frag
```

* Then edit the shader with your favorite text editor. 

```bash
vim test.frag
```

**Note**: In RaspberryPi you can avoid taking over the screen by using the ```-l``` or ```--live-coding``` flags so you can see the console. Also you can edit the shader file through ssh/sftp.

**Note**: On Linux and MacOS you may used to edit your shaders with Sublime Text 2, if thats your case you should try this [Sublime Text 2 plugin that lunch glslViewer every time you open a shader](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/glslViewer).

### Loading Vertex shaders and geometries

![](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/images/glslViewer-3D.gif)

You can also load both fragments and vertex shaders. Of course modifing a vertex shader makes no sense unless you load an interesting geometry. That's why ```glslViewer``` is can load ```.ply``` files. Try doing:

```bash
glslViewer bunny.frag bunny.vert bunny.ply
```

### Pre-Define ```uniforms``` and ```varyings```

* ```uniform float u_time;```: shader playback time (in seconds)

* ```uniform vec2 u_resolution;```: viewport resolution (in pixels)

* ```uniform vec2 u_mouse;```: mouse pixel coords

* ```varying vec2 v_texcoord```: UV of the billboard ( normalized )

### ShaderToy.com Image Shaders
ShaderToy.com image shaders are automatically detected and supported.
These conventions are also supported by other tools, such as Synthclipse.

To be recognized as a ShaderToy image shader, a fragment shader must define
```
  void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord)
```
It must not define `main()`, because this is automatically defined for you.

The following ShaderToy uniforms are automatically defined,
you don't declare them:
* `uniform vec3 iResolution;` <br>
  `iResolution.xy` is the viewport size in pixels, like `u_resolution`.
  `iResolution.z` is hard coded to 1.0, just like shadertoy.com and synthclipse,
  although it was originally supposed to be the pixel aspect ratio.
* `uniform float iGlobalTime;` <br>
  Shader playback time (in seconds), like `u_time`.
* `uniform float iTimeDelta;` <br>
  Render time for last frame (in seconds), like `u_delta`.
* `uniform vec4 iDate;` <br>
  [year, month (0-11), day of month (1-31), time of day (in seconds)],
  like `u_date`.
* `uniform vec4 iMouse;` <br>
  `iMouse` is initialized to 0, and only changes while the left mouse button
  (LMB) is being held down.
  * Mouse coordinates are integers in the range [0,0]..iResolution.xy.
  * `iMouse.xy` is the current mouse coordinates in pixels, while the LMB
    is being held down. When the LMB is released, `iMouse.xy` is set to the
    current coordinates, then stops changing.
  * `iMouse.zw` is set to the current mouse coordinates at the instant when
    the LMB is pressed, remains constant as long as the LMB is held down,
    and is set to `-iMouse.zw` when the LMB is released.
  * If the LMB is up, then iMouse.xy is the mouse location at the most recent
    mouseup event, and iMouse.zw is the negative of the mouse location at the
    most recent mousedown event.
    For example, after a mouse click, iMouse might be [216,320,-216,-320].

### Textures

You can load PNGs and JPEGs images to a shader. They will be automatically loaded and asigned to an uniform name acording to the order they are pass as arguments: ex. ```u_tex0```, ```u_tex1```, etc. Also the resolution will be assigned to ```vec2``` uniform acording the texture uniforma name: ex. ```u_tex0Resolution```, ```u_tex1Resolution```, etc. 

```bash
glslViewer test.frag test.png
```

In case you want to assign customs names to your textures uniforms you must specify the name with a flag before the texture file. For example to pass the following uniforms ```uniform sampled2D imageExample;``` and  ```uniform vec2 imageExampleResolution;``` is defined in this way:

```bash
glslViewer shader.frag -imageExample image.png
```

### Others arguments

Beside for texture uniforms other arguments can be add to ```glslViewer```:

* ```-x [pixels]``` set the X position of the billboard on the screen

* ```-y [pixels]``` set the Y position of the billboard on the screen

* ```-w [pixels]``` or ```--width [pixels]```  set the width of the billboard

* ```-h [pixels]``` or ```--height [pixels]``` set the height of the billboard

* ```-s [seconds]``` exit app after a specific amount of seconds

* ```-o [image.png]``` save the viewport to a image file before

* ```-l``` or ```--live-coding``` to draw a 500x500 billboard on the top right corner of the screen that let you see the code and the shader at the same time.

* ```--headless``` headless rendering. Very usefull for making images or benchmarking.

### Inject other files

You can include other GLSL code using a traditional ```#include “file.glsl”``` macro. Note: included files are not under watch so changes will not take effect until the main file is save.

## Examples

* Open a Fragment shader:

```bash
glslViewer examples/test.frag 
```

* Open a Fragment shader with an image:

```bash
glslViewer examples/test.frag examples/test.png
``` 

* Open a Fragment and Vertext shader with a geometry:

```bash
glslViewer examples/bunny.frag examples/bunny.vert examples/bunny.ply
``` 

* Open a Fragment that use the backbuffer to do a reaction diffusion example:

```bash
glslViewer examples/grayscott.frag
``` 

* Open a Fragment that use OS defines to know what platform is runnion on:

```bash
glslViewer examples/platform.frag
```

* Change a uniform value on the fly by passing CSV on the console IN:

```bash
glslViewer examples/temp.frag
u_temp,30
u_temp,40
u_temp,50
u_temp,60
u_temp,70
```

* Create a bash script to change uniform parameters on the fly:

```bash
examples/.temp.sh | glslViewer examples/temp.frag
```

* Run a headless instance of glslViewer that exits after 1 second outputing an PNG image

```bash
glslViewer examples/cross.frag --headless -s 1 -o cross.png 
```

* Make an SVG from a shader usin [potrace](http://potrace.sourceforge.net/) and [ImageMagic](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

```bash
glslViewer examples/cross.frag --headless -s 1 -o cross.png 
convert cross.png cross.pnm
potrace cross.pnm -s -o cross.svg 
```

* Open a ShaderToy's image shader

```bash
glslViewer examples/numbers.frag
```

* Download a shader shared through the [ShaderToy's](https://shadertoy.com/) by passing the ID `glslLoader`. Ex:

```bash
glslLoader llVXRd
```

* Download a shader shared through the [Book of Shader's](https://thebookofshaders.com/) [editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/) by passing the LOG number to `glslLoader`. Ex:

```bash
glslLoader 170208142327
```
